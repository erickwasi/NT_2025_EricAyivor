## A proposed framework for allocating foreign aid more efficiently
This project aimed to provide the basis for a more quantitative approach to allocating foreign aid by focusing on maximising sector resilience, the translation of sector resilience into GNI, and minimising time until a country "graduates". This repo contains the main simulation code, currently set up with parameters for Kenya in 2015, as well as the programs used to estimate governance sensitivity, sector elasticity, and population growth rate mean and stdev, as detailed in the report.

Extensive details can be found in the report, also attached in this repo for convenience.
